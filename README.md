# Structured Authoring: MS Word to OU Structured Content XML 
*Jon Rosewell, Jan 2025*

MS Word to OU structured content conversion, designed to replace OU IT/LDS customisation for oXygen. Additional XSLT for 1) OU XML to HTML (for import into Word) and 2) Numbering OU XML documents. 

Structured authoring allows OU course material destined for the VLE (or print) to be written in Word. It provides a quick preview / publish via oXygen. To preview:

1.	copy some or all of the Word document
2.	paste into a skeleton document in oXygen
3.	if necessary, attend to any errors shown
4.	click Render in the StructuredContent menu or toolbar
5.	if appropriate, click the Save link to publish on the VLE
6.	go home early ;-)

The Word document must be carefully styled using style names that correspond to OU structured content (SC) tags (element names); see the [Structured Content Tag Guide](https://learn3.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=185747) for the complete list. To author from scratch, use empty-sc.docx which contains the essential styles.
